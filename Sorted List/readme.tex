\section*{Big-O Analysis}

\subsection*{SLCreate}

This creates the memory for an empty sorted list. The analysis depends on what the
rest of the OS is doing, as it only allocates memory. 

$$O(1)$$

\subsection*{SLDestroy}

This frees all the memory for a list. The analysis depends on what the
rest of the OS is doing, as it only frees memory. 

$$O(1)$$

\subsection*{SLInsert}

This inserts an object into the sorted list.
This is a binary search tree where the worst case is one long branch.

$$O(n)$$

\subsection*{SLRemove}

This removes an object from the sorted list.
This is a binary search tree where the worst case is one long branch.

$$O(n)$$

\subsection*{SLCreateIterator}

This creates an object that allows the caller to iterate through the list.

$$O(1)$$

\subsection*{SLDestroyIterator}

This frees the memory used for an object that iterates through the list.

$$O(1)$$

\subsection*{SLNextItem}

Returns the next object from an iterator.

$$O(1)$$
