My methodology for testing this was deciding on my example
and then using Mac OS X's Spotlight feature on my actual
workspace to get the answers. 

Then I tested my program to compare against this.

-   Example 1: Here is an example where nothing
    is expected.
    -   Input:  sa Readme red meet
    -   Output: (nothing)

-   Example 2: Here is an example of a query that
    should only be found in one file under the more
    restrictive sa.
    -   Input:  sa PROVIDED PURPOSE
    -   Output: LICENSE

-   Example 3: Here is an edge case input that should
    be found in a lot of file.
    -   Input:  so a
    -   Output: tokenizer.c test.sh LICENSE readme.tex 
        readme.md testplan.txt Makefile sorted-list.h inverted.txt 
        6.txt

-   Example 4: Here is an example of an input which will
    limit the expected output by a great deal.
    -   Input:  sa a all
    -   Output: tokenizer.c LICENSE readme.tex Makefile 
        sorted-list.h 

-   Example 5: And here is that same one as a superset.
    -   Input:  so a all
    -   Output: tokenizer.c test.sh LICENSE readme.tex readme.md 
        testplan.txt Makefile sorted-list.h readme.aux main.c 
        inverted.txt 6.txt 8.txt 7.txt 3.txt

-   Example 6: Here is a big or example.
    -   Input:  so a b c d e f g h i j k
    -   Output: tokenizer.c test.sh readme.pdf LICENSE readme.tex 
        readme.md testplan.txt readme.log Makefile sorted-list.h 
        sorted-list.c index.c index.h tokenizer.h main.c inverted.txt 
        6.txt 5.txt 

-   Example 7: Here is an medium sized or example.
    -   Input:  
    -   Output: 

-   Example 8: A very inclusive or example based on common
    english words.
    -   Input:  so the a this while
    -   Output: tokenizer.c test.sh LICENSE Readme.md readme.tex readme.md 
        testplan.txt readme.log Makefile sorted-list.h sorted-list.c index.c 
        main.c inverted.txt 6.txt 2.txt 3.txt

-   Example 9: There is, however, only one file that contains
    all of these terms.
    -   Input:  sa the a this while
    -   Output: sorted-list.h 

-   Example 10: Very large example.
    -   Input:  so a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
    -   Output: tokenizer.c test.sh readme.pdf LICENSE readme.tex 
        readme.md testplan.txt readme.log Makefile sorted-list.h 
        sorted-list.c index.c index.h tokenizer.h main.c inverted.txt 
        6.txt 8.txt 5.txt
