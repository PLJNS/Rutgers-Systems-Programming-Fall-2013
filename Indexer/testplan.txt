Indexer Test Plan  
=================

I recommend three test cases for full robustness test.

I have created a very interested "tests" folder which
has enough to make it complicated and crash if your code
is bad.

I have transcribed the "boo/baa" test case from the definition.

And then I ran the code on my entire Systems Programming workspace,
which proved to succeed upon completion of the program.

In any other case, I recommend substituting my workspace for
one of your own, and then randomly confirming a few of the 
multiple cases.
